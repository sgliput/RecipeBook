## Overview

Recipe Book is a full-stack recipe-sharing application for posting recipes publicly or keeping a private collection accessible only to a specific logged-in user. The user interface was built with React.js, and it uses Bootstrap styling, a MongoDB database with Mongoose modeling, an Express server with routing, and some Material-UI components.
